A super lightweight jquery script to track scroll events in google analytics

To add this to your current website, download the javascript file and save it on a publicly accessible URL.
Then, on your code, simply include the javascript in your HTML 

Example:
&lt;script src="public-url-to-the-file/SimpleScroll.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

That is it.
